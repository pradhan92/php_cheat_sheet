//Explanation:
// 1.Public Modifier:
//     The name property and introduce() method in the Person class are marked public. This means 
//     they can be accessed from both inside and outside the class.
// 2.Protected Modifier:
//     The age property and showAge() method are marked protected. They are accessible inside the Person
//     class and any class that inherits from Person (such as Employee), but not outside these classes.
// 3.Private Modifier:
//     The nationalID property and showNationalID() method are marked private. They can only be accessed
//     from within the Person class itself, not even by classes that inherit from Person.
// 4.Inheritance:
//     The Employee class inherits from the Person class. It can access public and protected members 
//     from the parent class, but not private members.
